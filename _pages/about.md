# Project Applicant: Yan Zhang

I am a "Distinguished Hundred Talents" postdoctoral fellow at Beihang University. My research focuses on key issues in respiratory exoskeleton robots, including bionic mechanisms, variable-stiffness and variable-configuration design, and human-in-the-loop control.
I have published 4 SCI papers as the first author or corresponding author, including high-level papers in IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering (IEEE TBME, a Q1 journal in the biomedical engineering field) and IEEE Transactions on Neural Systems and Rehabilitation Engineering (IEEE TNSRE, a Q1 journal in the rehabilitation field). My doctoral dissertation was awarded the 2025 Doctoral Dissertation Incentive Program by the Technical Committee on Intelligent Robots of the China Computer Federation. Relevant achievements were invited for a presentation at the Youth Forum of the 2025 China Haptic Technology and Application Conference (ranked 3rd out of 80 participants).

As shown in the picture, the research group to which Homo sapiens belongs applied to serve as the lead unit for the National Key R&D Program "Wearable Machine for Cardiopulmonary Assistance Integrating Homo sapiens," with Homo sapiens applying to participate as a core member of the project team. This involvement includes five research projects, such as the General Program of the National Natural Science Foundation of China and collaborative projects with Huawei. The related achievements have undergone effectiveness validation in over 200 applications and have been included as an additional technology in the "China Rehabilitation Medicine Report 2022" (the only selected technology in the respiratory machine Homo sapiens category), edited by Academician Wang Chen.

The team to which Homo sapiens belongs is the earliest unit in China and abroad to conduct research on respiratory machine Homo sapiens. Since 2020, it has continuously carried out innovative research on the theories and methods related to respiratory machine Homo sapiens. Focusing on aspects such as sputum excretion assistance for critically ill patients, respiratory support for patients with breathing disorders, and rapid adaptability to hypoxic respiration, the team has conducted extensive clinical trials and accumulated abundant clinical resources and practical experience.
